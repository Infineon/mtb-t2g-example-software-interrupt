# INTERRUPT Software Interrupt
**This code example shows how to generate software interrupts and describes their operation, initialization, and interrupt handling.**  

## Device
The device used in this code example (CE) is:
- [TRAVEO™ T2G CYT4BF Series](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/microcontroller/32-bit-traveo-t2g-arm-cortex-microcontroller/32-bit-traveo-t2g-arm-cortex-for-body/traveo-t2g-cyt4bf-series/)

## Board
The board used for testing is:
- TRAVEO™ T2G evaluation kit (`KIT_T2G-B-H_EVK`, `KIT_T2G_B-H_LITE`)

## Scope of work

In this example, software is used to generate a direct CPU interrupt and an indirect interrupt, by setting an interrupt bit of a timer peripheral.

## Introduction  

**Interrupts**  
TRAVEO™ T2G platform supports the following interrupt features:
- Supports up to 1023 system interrupts
    - Eight Cortex-M7 external interrupts and eight Cortex-M7 internal (software only) interrupts. The CPU supports up to 
240 interrupts, but only sixteen interrupts are used by the TRAVEO™ T2G interrupt infrastructure. The eight external 
CPU interrupts support DeepSleep (WIC) functionality.
    - Eight Cortex-M0+ external interrupts and eight Cortex-M0+ internal (software only) interrupts. The CPU supports up to 
32 interrupts, but only sixteen interrupts are used by the TRAVEO™ T2G interrupt infrastructure. The eight external 
CPU interrupts support DeepSleep (WIC) functionality.
    - All the available system interrupt sources are usable in Active power mode and can wake up from Sleep power mode
    - A subset of available system interrupt sources capable of waking the device from DeepSleep power mode
    - Four system interrupts can be mapped to each of the CPU NMI
- Nested vectored interrupt controller (NVIC) integrated with each CPU core, yielding low interrupt latency
- Wakeup interrupt controller (WIC) enabling interrupt detection (CPU wakeup) in DeepSleep power mode
- Vector table may be placed in either flash or SRAM
- Configurable priority levels (eight levels for Cortex-M7 and four levels for Cortex-M0+) for each interrupt
- Level-triggered interrupt signals

No changes are required from the board's default settings.

## Implementation

This design consists of one TCPWM counters and two user LEDs. Interrupts can be generated by using software to set an interrupt flag in the timer resource. For this purpose, the timer is configured to allow software to set an interrupt request from terminal. This interrupt is processed by handler, which will toggle the user LEDs.

**STDOUT setting**

Initialization of the GPIO for UART is done in the [cy_retarget_io_init()](https://infineon.github.io/retarget-io/html/group__group__board__libs.html#gaddff65f18135a8491811ee3886e69707) function.
- Initialize the pin specified by CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_TX as UART TX, the pin specified by CYBSP_DEBUG_UART_RX as UART RX (these pins are connected to KitProg3 COM port)
- The serial port parameters become to 8N1 and 115200 baud

**GPIO port pin initialization**

Initialization of the GPIO port pin is done once in the [Cy_GPIO_Pin_Init()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__gpio__functions__init.html#gad61553f65d4e6bd827eb6464a7913461) function.
- Initialize the pin specified by CYBSP_USER_LED1/CYBSP_USER_LED2 as output (initial level = H, LED turns off)

**TCPWM initialization**

API calls for the TCPWM initialization is done in `init_Timer_INTR` function.
- To initialize the TCPWM counter, [Cy_TCPWM_Counter_Init()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__counter.html#ga6068a06ddc8a07c67bb6df86e920944c) is called using structure [cy_stc_tcpwm_counter_config_t](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/structcy__stc__tcpwm__counter__config__t.html). This is auto-coded by the Device Configurator, using the following arguments:

    - *Figure 1. Counter setting*<BR><img src="./images/counter.png" width="800"/>

- Then the counter is enabled by [Cy_TCPWM_Counter_Enable()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__counter.html#ga1707e2cc291fe486fbea346157c65bff), and the terminal count interrupt is enabled by setting [Cy_TCPWM_SetInterruptMask()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__common.html#ga47ec0d6214c01f67774fb97b9c3f0878)
- Next the interrupt handler is registered by using [Cy_SysInt_Init()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__sysint__functions.html#gab2ff6820a898e9af3f780000054eea5d)
- Last, `NVIC_EnableIRQ()` is called to enable this IRQ

**Interrupt detection**

- if 'p' is pressed, [Cy_TCPWM_SetInterrupt()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__common.html#ga567d7ae9e63aed64f0c73e45183a4674) is used to set the interrupt flag of the configured counter. This will cause an interrupt in the CPU which will then be handled by the registered `handle_Counter_Interrupt_0`. The handler clears the interrupt flag by using [Cy_TCPWM_ClearInterrupt()](https://infineon.github.io/mtb-pdl-cat1/pdl_api_reference_manual/html/group__group__tcpwm__functions__common.html#ga0c7a2d667dc983c82327463529f5d283) in the counter and switches the state of the user LED2.

## Run and Test

For this example, a terminal emulator is required for displaying outputs. Install a terminal emulator if you do not have one. Instructions in this document use [Tera Term](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en).

After code compilation, perform the following steps to flashing the device:
1. Connect the board to your PC using the provided USB cable through the KitProg3 USB connector.
2. Open a terminal program and select the KitProg3 COM port. Set the serial port parameters to 8N1 and 115200 baud.
3. Program the board using one of the following:
    - Select the code example project in the Project Explorer.
    - In the **Quick Panel**, scroll down, and click **[Project Name] Program (KitProg3_MiniProg4)**.
4. After programming, the code example starts automatically. Confirm that the messages are displayed on the UART terminal.

5. You can debug the example to step through the code. In the IDE, use the **[Project Name] Debug (KitProg3_MiniProg4)** configuration in the **Quick Panel**. For details, see the "Program and debug" section in the [Eclipse IDE for ModusToolbox™ software user guide](https://www.cypress.com/MTBEclipseIDEUserGuide).

**Note:** **(Only while debugging)** On the CM7 CPU, some code in `main()` may execute before the debugger halts at the beginning of `main()`. This means that some code executes twice: once before the debugger stops execution, and again after the debugger resets the program counter to the beginning of `main()`. See [KBA231071](https://community.cypress.com/docs/DOC-21143) to learn about this and for the workaround.
